# Honeybadger Test Node.js App

Welcome to a simple Node.js application that allows you to test the
[Honeybadger](https://www.honeybadger.io) monitoring platform for Node apps.
Honeybadger allows you to easily monitor for errors and outages, track
deployments, and diagnose performance issues and in your Node applications.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started with this application is to deploy it to
Heroku with the Heroku Button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

## Slightly Less Quick Start

If you'd like to do it the old fashioned way, follow these steps:

1. Sign up or sign in at [Honeybadger.io](https://www.honeybadger.io)
2. Create a new project and make a note of the api key on the settings
   page
3. Clone or download this app
4. Run `npm install` to get the necessary dependencies installed
5. Run the app: `HONEYBADGER_ENV=production HONEYBADGER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here node app.js`

## Trying It Out

Once you have the app running, either on Heroku or on your local
machine, browse to the running Node app. When you click on the first
link, an error will be triggered and reported to Honeybadger. Check
your email for a message from Honeybadger with a link to the error you
just recorded.

### Simulate a POST request

```sh
curl -d"foo=bar&bar=baz&password=sekret" -H"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" http://127.0.0.1:3000/fail
```

## Enjoy!

We hope this sample app gives you an easy way to see just how awesome
Honeybadger is. :) If you have any questions about this app or the
Honeybadger monitoring service, please feel free to drop us a line at
